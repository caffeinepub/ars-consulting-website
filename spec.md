# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the ARS Consulting website to use a white and yellow color theme with colored cards on all pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the global color theme to white backgrounds with yellow accents
- Update tailwind.config.js and index.css to reflect the new white and yellow color palette
- Add background colors to all card components across all pages (Home, About, Services, GCC, Industries, Insights, Careers, Contact)
- Ensure card colors are complementary to the white and yellow theme with sufficient text contrast

**User-visible outcome:** The website will have a fresh white and yellow color scheme with visually distinct colored cards throughout all pages, creating better visual hierarchy and improved aesthetics.
